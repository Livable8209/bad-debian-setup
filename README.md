# terrible debian setup script

Really terrible script because i keep installing debian over and over again
and i dont know how to do automated installs

this script is only for when you are on a fresh install of debian 12 (current release)

# usage

wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Livable8209/bad-debian-setup/main/install.sh | bash
